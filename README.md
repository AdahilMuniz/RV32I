RV32I - One More Implmentation
======

Hi! This is just a simple Risc-V implementation.

My goal with this project is to ~get rich~ learn about computer architecture implmentation as well as simulation tools/process and verification technics.

I pretend to work on this project for the time necessary to learn and to get skills in the subjects that I like ~that means a lot of time~. I hope too that this project could help other students interested in this subjects.

##Compiling and Running

To compile the codes present in the *Code_Examples* repository and run the simulation loading the generated binary in the core instruction memory execute the *build.sh* script passing the file name as argument. 

 > ./build.sh I_Type_Test
